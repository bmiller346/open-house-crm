## Monorepo Development Server Commands

To run the new monorepo servers, use the following commands:

**API Server (TypeScript, hot reload):**
```bash
cd apps/api

npx tsx src/server.ts
```
**Or, to run the compiled JavaScript:**
```bash
cd apps/api
npm run build
node dist/server.js
```

**Web App (Next.js):**
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

**Legacy (old) server/client (not recommended for new development):**
```bash
# From the root, runs old Express and React apps
npm run dev
```

> For more details, see `.copilot-instructions.md` in the repo root.
