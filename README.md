## Monorepo Development Server Commands

To run the new monorepo servers, use the following commands:

**API Server (TypeScript, hot reload):**
```bash
cd apps/api

npx tsx src/server.ts
```
**Or, to run the compiled JavaScript:**
```bash
cd apps/api
npm run build
node dist/server.js
```

**Web App (Next.js):**
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

**Legacy (old) server/client (not recommended for new development):**
```bash
# From the root, runs old Express and React apps
npm run dev
```

> For more details, see `.copilot-instructions.md` in the repo root.

## Development

Future development goals:

- Implementation of progressive web application tools
- Conversion to an npm package to allow developers easy access to components and tools for building custom implementations of the application
- Migrate from express to php back end
- Calendar module
- Dark mode option in my account settings page

**Developers wanted!** Open house is open to developers of all skill levels. It was created as a final project for a web development boot camp and we welcome students and self-studiers to get involved. See the [contributions](#contributions) section or [get in touch](#questions) to learn how.
